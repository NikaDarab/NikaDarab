Hello, I'm Nika 👋,

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [C3](https://coochiecare.club/), a subscription based service for all things vaginal care. 
     Another active project that I am very excited about is [FarsiLingo](https://farsilingo.com/), an educational platform for people interested in learning Farsi        and those in of a translator. This is ever evolving and in progess.
